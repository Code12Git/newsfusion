## Overview

NewsFusion is designed to simplify the process of staying updated with the latest news by curating news articles based on user interests. The application uses React.js for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MongoDB as the database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run NewsFusion,ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Installation


1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Code12Git/newsfusion.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies for both the client and server**:

    ```sh
    cd newsfusion/client
    npm install

    cd ../server
    npm install
    ```

## Architecture

NewsFusion follows a client-server architecture, with the following components:

- **Front-end (client)**: Built with React.js, the client-side application offers a user-friendly and responsive UI. Users can register, log in, select interests, view news articles, save articles for later and view recommended articles.

- **Back-end (server)**: Developed using Node.js and Express.js, the server-side application handles user authentication, interest management, article fetching, saving, and recommendation. It communicates with the MongoDB database to store user data.

## Features

### User Registration and Authentication

NewsFusion provides a user registration and authentication system. Users can sign up for an account, log in with their credentials, and enjoy a personalized news experience.

## Interest Selection

Users can select their interests (e.g., technology, sports, politics, health) in their profile settings. This helps tailor the news feed to their preferences.

## News Feed

The main page displays a curated news feed based on the user's selected interests. The application fetches news articles from a public news API (e.g., NewsAPI) which is setup in server side to provide up-to-date content.

## Article Saving

Users have the option to save articles for later reading. Saved articles are accessible from the user's profile and are not subject to deletion or expiration.

## Article Recommendation

Based on the user's reading history, NewsFusion recommends additional articles they might find interesting. The recommendation engine considers the user's selected interests and previously viewed articles.

## Design Decisions

During the development of NewsFusion, several design decisions were made to ensure an efficient and user-friendly experience:

1.**Front-end Framework**: React.js was chosen for the front-end due to its component-based architecture, reusability, and ability to create dynamic user interfaces.

2.**Back-end Framework**: Node.js and Express.js were selected for the back-end to build a lightweight and fast server, allowing seamless communication between the front-end and the database.

3.**Database**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was chosen for its flexibility in handling unstructured data and its ease of integration with Node.js.

4.**User Authentication**: User authentication is implemented using cookies and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and stateful user sessions.

5.**Interest Management**: Users can select their interests after registration, enhancing their news feed experience by offering a diverse range of articles.

6.**Article Fetching**: News articles are fetched from a public news API, allowing the application to provide real-time and up-to-date content to users.

7.**Recommended Articles**:News articles are recommended based on their selected interest and user viewing articles.
